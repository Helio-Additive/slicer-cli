# libslic3r-rs ↔ BambuStudio G-code Parity — Status

Goal: the Rust slicer (`crates/libslic3r-rs`, the `slicer` crate) produces G-code
**byte-identical** to C++ BambuStudio for the same job. Branch:
`alex/libslic3r-parity-engine`.

## How to measure

The two-engine compare harness runs the *same* job through C++ BambuStudio
(subprocess) and the Rust engine (in-process) and diffs the G-code:

```
COMPARE_KEEP_DIR=/tmp/cmp devbox run -- \
  target/debug/slicer-cli compare --config tests/configs/stl-inline-config.jsonnet
```

- Dumps `native.gcode` / `rust.gcode` to `$COMPARE_KEEP_DIR`.
- A clean Benchy slice takes **~17 s**. If it takes minutes, suspect orphaned
  slicer processes saturating CPU (`pkill -f slicer-cli`).
- **Per-feature MATERIAL** must be measured with `/tmp/feat_e2.py` (counts E only
  on moves with real XY motion). The naive sum (`feat_e.py`) is **contaminated by
  deretraction-priming** moves and inflates native — do not trust it.
- Track the **header filament length** and **per-feature material dE** (rust−native),
  not feature *counts* (counts are a feature-run-segmentation artifact).

## Current parity (at `f67f3f4`, ROUND 48 — see memory `project_benchy_parity_gap.md` for the round-by-round log)

- **Material: 0.99771×** — header filament rust 3850.13 / native 3858.97 mm (XY-gated `feat_e2.py`).
- **Time estimate: CONVERGED** — native 43m0s / rust 43m21s (the old "1h29m vs 43m"
  line-3 divergence is **RESOLVED**; the overhang/speed trio below is landed).
- **Byte-identical: NO**, but the structural subsystems now match or are faithful:
  outer-wall vertex density matches native (offset rerouted to clipper-z-sys),
  gap-fill 81% closed, seam ~89% byte-exact at established layers, arc-fitter /
  simplification / medial-axis (boostvoronoi) / chaining / retraction all proven faithful.
- **Remaining residual is surface CLASSIFICATION** (not geometry/units): rust
  over-fills **bridge-infill** (moves 1286→2346) and under-blocks **internal-solid**
  (389→134 blocks), which also drives the systematic extrusion-arc over (+~1250,
  a downstream symptom of fragmentation — the arc-fitter itself is byte-faithful).

## What's done (verified, on the branch)

- Surface classification: removed a spurious mesh-slicer `detect_surfaces_type`
  that fragmented surfaces (3/layer → 37-44) — **Top surface → parity**.
- Gap-fill: fixed a `variable_width` mm/scaled units bug + a missing
  `douglas_peucker` pre-simplify (gap-fill is at parity; the apparent gap was a
  priming-measurement artifact).
- Arc-fitting: wired `ArcFitter` into G-code export — **0 → ~12k G2/G3 moves**
  (native ~12k); also fixed a missing arc filament-length accumulation.
- Time estimator: ran the (faithful) `GCodeProcessor` and wired its accel-aware
  time into the header (correct format `; estimated printing time (normal mode) =`).
- Per-segment **speed modulation** (overhang speed + smooth-speed): toolpath
  density now matches native (outer-wall ~40k moves, ~6.7k distinct feedrates).
- **`crates/clipper-z-sys`**: vendored BambuStudio `ClipperLib_Z` (clipper.cpp +
  `CLIPPERLIB_USE_XYZ`) via a C-ABI shim; `clip_extrusion` validated. Portable
  binary (static C++; only libc++/libstdc++ residual). Wraps in
  `crates/libslic3r-rs/src/clipper_z.rs`.

## Remaining levers (all foundational/large — tackle as separate scoped efforts)

1. **Overhang trio + time-estimate — RESOLVED (ROUND 48).** `overhang_degree` is now
   `f64`, `merge_same_speed_paths` and `detect_bridge_wall` are ported + called, the
   speed interpolation is faithful, and the **time estimate converged (43m0s vs 43m21s)**.
   Overhang-wall feature matches (90 vs 91). This whole lever is done — do not re-attempt.
2. **Bridge-infill surface OVER-detection (PRIMARY remaining lever).** rust over-fills
   bridge-infill (moves 1286→2346) and under-blocks internal-solid (389→134 blocks;
   material 494→414). Surface that native fills as **internal-solid** is being routed to
   **bridge-infill** in rust → over-bridged/fragmented regions also drive the systematic
   extrusion-arc over (+~1250; the arc-fitter itself is byte-faithful, ROUND 43). Root is
   in `LayerRegion::process_external_surfaces` / `BridgeDetector` over-marking
   `stBottomBridge`/`stInternalBridge`. A **classification** fix (the recurring tractable
   bug class), NOT `wave_seeds`/`detect_bridge_wall` (those are done). This SUPERSEDES the
   old "−187 E bridge material" framing and is the likely primary cause of the
   internal-solid under-volume (re-assess any Arachne narrow-fill residual — ROUND 47,
   `/tmp/solid_findings.md` — only AFTER this lands).
3. **Clipper coordinate byte-exactness (F1).** The live clipper backend is
   `geo-clipper` at scale 1000 (1 µm grid) fed via an mm float round-trip, vs C++
   ClipperLib at scale 100000. For byte-exact coordinates, feed the C++ clipper the
   same i64 inputs (raw FFI / vendor BambuStudio's exact `clipper.cpp` as a `-sys`
   crate). NOTE: F1 is *not* the cause of the toolpath-density gap (verified —
   bumping the scale changed nothing).
4. **Seam / toolpath ordering** — perimeter/seam emission order differs; needed
   before the two G-code streams are 1:1 alignable past the headers.
5. **Byte-exact bridges/overhang** would use **Clipper2Lib_Z** (`SetZCallback` +
   Z-preserving Clipper2 offset), a later `clipper-z-sys` extension.

## Notes

- `cargo test` for the `slicer` lib is **pre-existing-broken** (unrelated
  arachne/surface/fill errors) — only `cargo build` gates are authoritative on this
  branch. `clipper-z-sys` tests pass.
- Many compiler warnings are intentional: `///` C++-reference doc comments and
  faithfully-ported-but-gated/unwired code.
