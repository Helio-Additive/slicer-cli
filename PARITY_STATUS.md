# libslic3r-rs ↔ BambuStudio G-code Parity — Status

Goal: the Rust slicer (`crates/libslic3r-rs`, the `slicer` crate) produces G-code
**byte-identical** to C++ BambuStudio for the same job. Branch:
`alex/libslic3r-parity-engine`.

## How to measure

The two-engine compare harness runs the *same* job through C++ BambuStudio
(subprocess) and the Rust engine (in-process) and diffs the G-code:

```
COMPARE_KEEP_DIR=/tmp/cmp devbox run -- \
  target/debug/slicer-cli compare --config tests/configs/stl-inline-config.jsonnet
```

- Dumps `native.gcode` / `rust.gcode` to `$COMPARE_KEEP_DIR`.
- A clean Benchy slice takes **~17 s**. If it takes minutes, suspect orphaned
  slicer processes saturating CPU (`pkill -f slicer-cli`).
- **Per-feature MATERIAL** must be measured with `/tmp/feat_e2.py` (counts E only
  on moves with real XY motion). The naive sum (`feat_e.py`) is **contaminated by
  deretraction-priming** moves and inflates native — do not trust it.
- Track the **header filament length** and **per-feature material dE** (rust−native),
  not feature *counts* (counts are a feature-run-segmentation artifact).

## Current parity (at `1ee3ea4`)

- **Material: 0.986×** — header filament rust 3794.94 / native 3858.97 mm.
- **Byte-identical: NO** — first divergence is **line 3** (header time-estimate value).
- Material correctness is strong: walls, gap-fill, arcs, and toolpath density are
  all at/near parity. Remaining material gap is concentrated in **bridges**
  (rust 15 vs native 38; ~−187 E), which is *perf-blocked* (see below).

## What's done (verified, on the branch)

- Surface classification: removed a spurious mesh-slicer `detect_surfaces_type`
  that fragmented surfaces (3/layer → 37-44) — **Top surface → parity**.
- Gap-fill: fixed a `variable_width` mm/scaled units bug + a missing
  `douglas_peucker` pre-simplify (gap-fill is at parity; the apparent gap was a
  priming-measurement artifact).
- Arc-fitting: wired `ArcFitter` into G-code export — **0 → ~12k G2/G3 moves**
  (native ~12k); also fixed a missing arc filament-length accumulation.
- Time estimator: ran the (faithful) `GCodeProcessor` and wired its accel-aware
  time into the header (correct format `; estimated printing time (normal mode) =`).
- Per-segment **speed modulation** (overhang speed + smooth-speed): toolpath
  density now matches native (outer-wall ~40k moves, ~6.7k distinct feedrates).
- **`crates/clipper-z-sys`**: vendored BambuStudio `ClipperLib_Z` (clipper.cpp +
  `CLIPPERLIB_USE_XYZ`) via a C-ABI shim; `clip_extrusion` validated. Portable
  binary (static C++; only libc++/libstdc++ residual). Wraps in
  `crates/libslic3r-rs/src/clipper_z.rs`.

## Remaining levers (all foundational/large — tackle as separate scoped efforts)

1. **Time / line-3 (byte first-divergence).** The estimator is *faithful* (proven:
   the native C++ GCodeProcessor on rust's own gcode gives the same time). The
   overshoot (1h29m vs 43m) is the toolpath over-fragmenting because overhang
   grading over-classifies. Root is a **tangled trio** — `ExtrusionPath.overhang_degree`
   is `i32` (C++ `double`, defeats speed interpolation) + missing `detect_bridge_wall`
   + `merge_same_speed_paths` interaction. **Partial fixes regress** (tried 3×);
   needs all parts changed together. Default keeps the midpoint-baseline overhang
   (least-wrong).
2. **Bridges (−187 E material).** `wave_seeds` region-expansion is ported on the
   `clipper-z-sys` `ClipperLib_Z` engine and produces correct non-zero seeds — but
   it is **100-1000× too slow** (one FFI round-trip per (src,boundary) region per
   layer → 45-60 min/slice). Preserved on branch **`bridges-wip-perf-blocked`**.
   Needs an **FFI-batching perf pass** (one call per layer-region set) before it's
   viable, then measure.
3. **Clipper coordinate byte-exactness (F1).** The live clipper backend is
   `geo-clipper` at scale 1000 (1 µm grid) fed via an mm float round-trip, vs C++
   ClipperLib at scale 100000. For byte-exact coordinates, feed the C++ clipper the
   same i64 inputs (raw FFI / vendor BambuStudio's exact `clipper.cpp` as a `-sys`
   crate). NOTE: F1 is *not* the cause of the toolpath-density gap (verified —
   bumping the scale changed nothing).
4. **Seam / toolpath ordering** — perimeter/seam emission order differs; needed
   before the two G-code streams are 1:1 alignable past the headers.
5. **Byte-exact bridges/overhang** would use **Clipper2Lib_Z** (`SetZCallback` +
   Z-preserving Clipper2 offset), a later `clipper-z-sys` extension.

## Notes

- `cargo test` for the `slicer` lib is **pre-existing-broken** (unrelated
  arachne/surface/fill errors) — only `cargo build` gates are authoritative on this
  branch. `clipper-z-sys` tests pass.
- Many compiler warnings are intentional: `///` C++-reference doc comments and
  faithfully-ported-but-gated/unwired code.
