# Semantic-equivalence parity test

Verifies that the Rust engine (`crates/libslic3r-rs`) produces G-code that is
**physically equivalent** to C++ BambuStudio — the same printed object — rather
than byte-identical text.

## Why not byte-for-byte?

Byte-identical G-code is infeasible and not the right bar. The two engines run
the same geometry math but round floating-point differently, because their
compilers (Rust's `cc` build vs C++'s `cmake`) emit different CPU instructions.
Those sub-ULP differences **cascade**: a tiny difference in an early slicing
step flips a downstream decision (which area is a bridge, where an infill line
starts), re-routing toolpaths by 10–100 µm without changing the printed part.
~99% of the raw byte-diff is exactly this cascade noise. See `PARITY_STATUS.md`
(R324–R326 prove the FP wall; R335/R346 establish the semantic approach).

The genuinely fixable differences that this campaign *did* land (bridge and
first-layer flow model bugs, −446 bytes) are the exception; the rest is the wall.

## What it checks

`scripts/semantic_compare.py <rust.gcode> <native.gcode>` prints a report and
exits **0 iff SEMANTICALLY EQUIVALENT**. The five tolerance checks:

| Check | Tolerance | Measures |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| object material | within 1% | retraction-aware deposited-E total (the part's material, excluding skirt/prime and deretraction priming) |
| layer count | equal | slice structure |
| per-layer material | mean dev < 5% | material distribution over Z |
| per-feature material | worst < 35% | catches a missing/doubled/halved feature (loose: known FP-cascade classes like vertical shell drift ~20%) |
| object silhouette | area-wtd IoU ≥ 99% | printed cross-sectional SHAPE |

**Silhouette** = region-closed all-coverage IoU: rasterize every extrusion,
morphologically close by 4mm to bridge infill/seam gaps, recovering the filled
cross-section. Robust across convex, non-convex, and curved geometry (a
sub-width wall offset barely moves it). Tunable via `SIL_RES`/`SIL_CLOSE_K`.

## Slice-time parity

Physical equivalence says the two engines print the *same object*; it says
nothing about how long each took. Slice time is tracked separately, because a
toolpath can be shape-correct yet much slower to compute. The `compare`
subcommand now wall-clock-times both engines and prints a `--- slice time ---`
section: the C++ subprocess time (includes process spawn/teardown), the Rust
in-process time, and the `rust/bambu` ratio with a verdict
(`at parity ≤1.10x` / `slower` / `much slower ≥2x`).

```sh
# best-of-N Rust runs suppresses first-run cold-cache noise
COMPARE_TIMING_RUNS=5 devbox run -- \
  target/release/slicer-cli compare --config tests/configs/stl-inline-config.jsonnet
```

Because the C++ number carries subprocess overhead the in-process Rust path does
not, treat the ratio as an order-of-magnitude guide (Benchy is small enough that
spawn cost is a large fraction), not a microbenchmark. The signal to watch is
large models (Majora) where compute dominates spawn.

## How to run

```sh
# needs numpy — run under devbox
devbox run -- bash tests/test_semantic_parity.sh          # Benchy + Cube suite
devbox run -- bash tests/test_semantic_parity.sh <cfg>    # a specific config
devbox run -- python3 scripts/semantic_compare.py a.gcode b.gcode   # ad hoc
```

The wrapper runs `slicer-cli compare` (both engines) then the comparison, and is
wired into CI (`.github/workflows/slicer-cli-ci.yml`). It **skips gracefully**
(exit 0) if numpy or a binary is unavailable. Env: `SLICER_CLI`, `PYTHON`,
`BAMBUSTUDIO_SLICER`.

## Current status

- **Benchy** (`stl-inline-config.jsonnet`): SEMANTICALLY EQUIVALENT — shape 99.8%, object material 0.9998.
- **Cube** (`stl-cube-config.jsonnet`): SEMANTICALLY EQUIVALENT — shape 100%.

Both are locked into CI, so a genuinely-broken toolpath (silhouette or material
collapse) is caught, while FP-cascade re-routing correctly passes.

## Known limitations

- **Origin-centered models** (e.g. a sphere STL centered at (0,0,0)) place
  differently between the engines: rust drops-to-bed and slices the full model,
  native slices in place (only the part above Z=0). Use bed-placed models.
- **Very small models**: the header filament total is dominated by skirt/prime;
  the `object material` check (deposited-E, retraction-aware) is the reliable
  material signal.
- The per-feature/per-layer material metrics are retraction-aware (R356), so
  they no longer carry deretraction-priming noise.
